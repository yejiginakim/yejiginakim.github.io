## **Predicting Roadkill Level in Hongcheon, Gangwondo, Korea** 

This dashboard shows the roadkill points that occurred in Hongcheon, Gangwon-do, Korea, during 2020, 2021, and 2022.

### 2. Goal
<br>
The ultimate goal is not only to predict roadkill risk levels (low, medium, high) in Hongcheon, but also to analyze the environmental and infrastructural characteristics of high-risk grids, providing deeper insights into why incidents occur more frequently.

### Explanatory Variables

| Variable             | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `national_highway_rk`| Roadkill count on national, provincial, and highway roads                   |
| `white_rk`           | Roadkill count on ordinary/local roads (non-national/provincial/highway)    |
| `corridor_count`     | Number of ecological corridors within the grid                              |
| `min_dist_to_corridor` | Minimum distance (m) to the nearest ecological corridor                   |
| `wild_boar_count`    | Scaled estimate of wild boar distribution in the grid                       |
| `roe_deer_count`     | Scaled estimate of roe deer distribution in the grid                        |
| `white_road_grade`   | Categorical index (0â€“4) describing road presence and surrounding land use   |
| `speed_proxy`        | Proxy for speed limits based on road type composition (highway, national)   |


### 3. Methodology & Summary

  + With the **SGDClassifier**, clear overfitting was observed between the training and validation sets.  
  + The **neural network with two hidden layers trained using SGD** achieved 100% accuracy on both the training and validation data.  
 + Based on this stability, the neural network model was applied to predict Hongcheon grids, identifying the following as **high-risk areas (level 2)**:  
  - `grid_333`  
  - `grid_364`  
  - `grid_494`  
  - `grid_526`  

These results highlight specific locations in Hongcheon that warrant further attention for roadkill mitigation and conservation planning.
