👋🏽 Hello, my name is Yeji Kim. 

🎓 Soon to be grad with a M.S. in Statistics at Stony Brook University. (December 2024)

🌇 New York City Native, with a passion for developing and applying mathematical and statistical models to hands-on strategies that will grow business.

📚 I began my higher education at Suny Korea, part of Stony Brook University, absorbing the foundational principles of statistics in a curriculum aligned with its U.S. standards. Transitioning to Stony Brook University in the United States for my mandatory final undergraduate year, I continued to engage with core statistical concepts, setting the stage for advanced study. My pursuit of a Master’s degree, also at Stony Brook, has deepened my understanding of statistics, preparing me for its practical application in data-driven business environments. I am set to graduate in the fall of 2024.


💻 In the future, I aspire to apply my skills in data analysis to drive impactful marketing strategies. My goal is to work collaboratively with marketing teams, using data-driven insights to enhance decision-making and optimize business outcomes.


🏔 In my free time, I enjoy listening to songs by the K-pop idol group Day6.
